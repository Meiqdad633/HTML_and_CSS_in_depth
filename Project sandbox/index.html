          <h3>1-Shirl’s Plant Therapy Variegated Arrowhead Vine</h3>
          <p>“Just like other variegated plants, the beauty exists in its tricolor foliage,” says Carter. “It will need its soil to stay evenly moist, so you’ll have to water it more frequently during spring and summer. Don’t ever let the soil completely dry out. It thrives in humidity.”</p>

          <h3>2-ZZ Plant</h3>
          <p>You’ll be able to catch plenty of Zs if you invest in a ZZ plant—also known as the Zamioculcas zamiifolia—as it is one of the lowest-maintenance options on the market. It only needs to be watered three times a month, doesn’t require a lot of light, and will not attract bugs or other pests</p>

          <h3>3-BijanTropicals Aralia Fabian</h3>
          <p>“The Aralia Fabian reminds me of something out of a Dr. Seuss book. Its beauty and weirdness comes from its thick burly trunk, thin speckled branches, and pancake-shaped foliage that’s a dark shade of green on top and a shade of violet on the bottom,” says Carter. “To care for it, place your plant in a pot that has a drainage hole and water it until water comes out in the base tray.”</p>

          <h3>4-New Weeping Fig</h3>
          <p>It may be a weeping fig, but it could be a green vignette of joy in your apartment. These little trees can add the necessary amount of green we all need for a small space, and they only require watering every four to seven days. Place in a window that gets bright, indirect sunlight, turning the plant every once in a while to avoid excess growth on one side.</p>

          <h3>5-Bloomscape Burgundy Rubber Tree</h3>
          <p>“This is one of my favorite ficus trees,” says Carter. “It’s less finicky than its popular cousin, the fiddle-leaf fig, and it can grow up to 25 feet indoors. When it comes to light, it does well when it’s bright and indirect. Keep the soil moist during the growing season, which is summer. In the winter, the soil needs less moisture.”.</p>

          <h3>6-Urban Stems Pilea Peperomioides</h3>
          <p>“This is a widely loved plant with many endearing nicknames like UFO plant, pancake plant, and Chinese money plant,” says Carter. “Its love of humidity makes it a great way to add color to a bathroom. The sprouted leafy discs could also work in any space with bright indirect light. Let the soil dry out between waterings to avoid root rot. Their leaves will droop a bit when they are thirsty.”</p>

          <h3>7-Dieffenbachia</h3>
          <p>The dieffenbachia, a classic houseplant to add to your indoor garden, features large, mottled leaves. Like so many plants, however, this one can fall victim to overwatering. But with well-draining soil and filtered light, it will be good to grow.</p>

          <h3>8-Peace Lily</h3>
          <p>If you like the look of the pink anthurium above, a peace lily may also be right for you. Like the previous plant, the peace lily is relatively easy to care for and produces its signature sculptural blooms year-round. Just be sure to keep it out of direct sunlight and avoid overwatering. As with the pink anthurium, it’s toxic to children and pets if consumed, so do keep it out of reach.</p>

          <h3>9-Pink Anthurium</h3>
          <p>This plant (also known as a flamingo or pigtail plant) is an Instagram fave, and it’s easy to see why, with its heart-shaped leaves, waxy, salmon-colored blooms, and sculptural spadix. This plant thrives in damp conditions, so consider placing it in a well-lit bathroom. Keep out of reach of kids, dogs, and cats, however—it is poisonous if ingested.</p>
